‚óè	Disk Scheduling Algorithm
The technique that the operating system uses to determine the request which is to be satisfied next is called disk scheduling. The operating system must be fair enough to satisfy each request and at the same time, the operating system must maintain the efficiency and speed of process execution.
The seek time is the time for the disk arm to move the heads to the cylinder containing the desired sector. The rotational latency is the additional time for the disk to rotate the desired sector to the disk head. The disk bandwidth is the total number of bytes transferred, divided by the total time between the first request for service and the completion of the last transfer. We can improve both the access time and the bandwidth by managing the order in which disk I/O requests are serviced.
